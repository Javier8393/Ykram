## INCOME METHODS

### Affiliation

#### What is affiliation and what is an affiliate link? What does it consist of?

Affiliation is a contract between two parties whereby one, who offers a product or service, allows the other party to advertise this product or service in exchange for a commission or economic benefit. This commission or economic benefit is delivered from the first to the second party when it is verified that the second party has been responsible for favoring the sale. This verification can be in the form of a special coupon, a link that installs an informative cookie on the customer's machine, or some other similar form.

This economic benefit is given without any prejudice to the price of the product, so the final customer will not experience any increase in the price.

On www.ykramstudio.com you can find affiliate links from the following platforms:

- **Amazon Affiliates:** Whose legal terms can be found at [Amazon Affiliates](https://afiliados.amazon.es/help/operating/policies).
